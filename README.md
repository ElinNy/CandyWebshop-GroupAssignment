# CandyWebshop-GroupAssignment
We made a webshop for candies in a group assignment in a group of three.

We fetched the candies from an API given to us and we used TypeScript. 
Then being able to place an order using POST and give back the confirmation with an order ID to the user. 

Here's the link to the app.
